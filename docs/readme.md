###### 2014/06/24 - We are migrating this project from Sourceforge, which inadvertently dropped support for MediaWiki. Documentation is in the process of being imported/adapted (by salvaging it from the Google cache and translating to Markdown via pandoc), and is slowly becoming available in the [docs dir](docs) (please be aware that there are many broken links and missing images - bug reports welcome).
