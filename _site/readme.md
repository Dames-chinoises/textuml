###### 2014/06/24 - We are migrating this project from Sourceforge, which inadvertently dropped support for MediaWiki. Documentation is in the process of being imported/adapted (by salvaging it from the Google cache and translating to Markdown via pandoc), and is slowly becoming available in the [docs dir](docs) (please be aware there are many broken links and missing images). 

TextUML Toolkit
===============


[![Build Status](https://textuml.ci.cloudbees.com/buildStatus/icon?job=textuml-toolkit)](https://textuml.ci.cloudbees.com/job/textuml-toolkit/)

TextUML Toolkit is an **open-source IDE for UML** that lets you create
models at the same speed you write code. By adopting **a textual
notation**, the TextUML Toolkit provides benefits you will not get
elsewhere:

-   **increased modeling productivity**
-   **compatible** with any tools that support [Eclipse
    UML2](http://wiki.eclipse.org/MDT-UML2-Tool-Compatibility "http://wiki.eclipse.org/MDT-UML2-Tool-Compatibility")
    models
-   the features you like in your favorite IDE: **instant validation,
    syntax highlighting, outline view, textual comparison**
-   **live graphical visualization** of your model as class diagrams


Will you only believe it if you see it? **[Download and
install](docs/install.md "Install Instructions")**
the TextUML Toolkit (it is free!) and run through the **easy-to-follow
[tutorial](docs/tutorial.md "TextUML Tutorial")**.
After the initial tour, you will want to become familiar with the
**[documentation](docs "Documentation Home")**.**Questions
and problem reports** can be posted on the **[user
forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/textuml-toolkit)**
and **[issue
tracker](https://github.com/abstratt/textuml/issues)**.
