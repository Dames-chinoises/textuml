TextUML Toolkit
===============


[![Build Status on Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/abstratt/textuml.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/abstratt/textuml)


TextUML Toolkit is an **open-source IDE for UML** that lets you create
models at the same speed you write code. By adopting **a textual
notation**, the TextUML Toolkit provides benefits you will not get
elsewhere:

-   **increased modeling productivity**
-   **compatible** with any tools that support [Eclipse
    UML2](http://wiki.eclipse.org/MDT-UML2-Tool-Compatibility "http://wiki.eclipse.org/MDT-UML2-Tool-Compatibility")
    models
-   the features you like in your favorite IDE: **instant validation,
    syntax highlighting, outline view, textual comparison**
-   **live graphical visualization** of your model as class diagrams

The TextUML Toolkit can be used as a [plug-in for the Eclipse](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/textuml-toolkit) IDE, as an [independent command-line tool](https://github.com/abstratt/standalone-textuml), and as a part of a multi-tenant server-side application - as seen in [Cloudfier](http://github.com/abstratt/cloudfier/).
